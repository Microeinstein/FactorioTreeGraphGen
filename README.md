# Factorio Tree Graph Generator
This script produces a GraphML file, which have to be opened with [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/downloads#yEd) to:
1. fit all the nodes to their labels
2. apply a hierarchical layout to the elements

This script needs my [personal Lua framework](https://github.com/Microeinstein/LuaPersonalFramework) and a terminal with ANSI support.

### ANSI on Windows
You can use:
1. [ANSICON](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon)
2. [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
3. [my native helper](https://github.com/Microeinstein/LuaNativeHelper)
